One more small project is made in a classic modular style and compiled using **webpack** and **gulp**.The project includes the **jQuery library** and **slick-carausel** (as a package.json dependency). I worked with the completed layout. 

The goal of the project was to train the skills of working with simple functionality on the site: 
- configure the project's assembly
- modal windows (*button* "Вызвать замерщика", *link* "Заказать обратный звонок" and "Спросите у нашего специалиста!").
- tabs
- forms
- form - calculator (button "Рассчитать стоимость")
- timer
- image display module (enlarged when clicked)

The project is **validated** without errors and warnings, all **images are optimized** and the site is **adaptive** for mobile phone, tablet and desktop.
